# for a box instance to provide picobox-level set of functions that mimic Box
# interface but deal with a box at the top. While it's not completely necessary
# for methods like put() and get(), it's crucial for pass_() due to its

    Returns a context manager, that will automatically pop the box from the
    top of the stack on exit. Can also be used as a regular function, in
    which case it's up to callers to perform a corresponding call to
    :func:`pop()`, when they are done with the box.

    The box on the top is used by :func:`put`, :func:`get` and :func:`pass_`
    functions (not methods) and together they define a so called Picobox's
    stacked interface. The idea behind stacked interface is to provide a way
    to easily switch DI containers (boxes) without changing injections.

    Here's a minimal example of how push can be used (as a context manager)::

        import picobox

        @picobox.pass_('magic')
        def do(magic):
            return magic + 1

        foobox = picobox.Box()
        foobox.put('magic', 42)

        barbox = picobox.Box()
        barbox.put('magic', 13)

        with picobox.push(foobox):
            with picobox.push(barbox):
                assert do() == 14
            assert do() == 43

    As a regular function::

        picobox.push(foobox)
        picobox.push(barbox)

        assert do() == 14
        picobox.pop()

        assert do() == 43
        picobox.pop()

    :param box: A :class:`Box` instance to push to the top of the stack.
    :param chain: (optional) Look up missed keys one level down the stack. To
        look up through multiple levels, each level must be created with this
        option set to ``True``.

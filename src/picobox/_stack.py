class Stack:
    """Stack is a dependency injection (DI) container for containers (boxes).

    While :class:`Box` is a great way to manage dependencies, it has no means
    to override them. This might be handy most of all in tests, where you
    usually need to provide a special set of dependencies configured for
    test purposes. This is where :class:`Stack` comes in. It provides the very
    same interface Box does, but proxies all calls to a box on the top.

    This basically means you can define injection points once, but change
    dependencies on the fly by changing DI containers (boxes) on the stack.
    Here's a minimal example of how a stack can be used::

        import picobox

        stack = picobox.Stack()

        @stack.pass_('magic')
        def do(magic):
            return magic + 1

        foobox = picobox.Box()
        foobox.put('magic', 42)

        barbox = picobox.Box()
        barbox.put('magic', 13)

        with stack.push(foobox):
            with stack.push(barbox):
                assert do() == 14
            assert do() == 43

    .. note::

        Usually you want to have only one stack instance to wire things up.
        That's why picobox comes with pre-created stack instance. You can
        work with that instance using :func:`push`, :func:`pop`, :func:`put`,
        :func:`get` and :func:`pass_` functions.

    :param name: (optional) A name of the stack.

    DI container is an object that contains any amount of factories, one for
    each dependency apart. Dependency, on the other hand, is an ordinary
    instance or value the container needs to provide on demand.

    Thanks to scopes, the class keeps track of produced dependencies and knows
    exactly when to reuse them or when to create new ones. That is to say each
    scope defines a set of rules for when to reuse dependencies.
